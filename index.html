                <h3>What is this graph about?</h2>
                <p id = 'test'>This graph shows the hourly average Karma Point of the Reddit posts split 
                    between Jpg/Gif images from the hot tab of the 
                    <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/" target="_blank">r/dankmemes</a> subreddit. 
                </p>
                <h3>How is this calculated?</h2>
                <p>It first looks at the 7 days most recent dankmemes hot posts. 
                    Then it uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average" target="_blank">
                        cumulative moving average</a> to calculate the mean of 
                    hourly posts from that time period.
                </p>
                <h3>What can this be used for?</h2>
                <p>Give insights into the trend of posting either animated or still memes into r/dankmemes. 
                    Other than that, not much at its current stage honestly. However, this will serve as a 
                    foundation for me to build and add more feature to this website</p>
                <h3>So, why does this exist?</h2>
                <p>I don't know. The reason is probably a mix of boredom and a tad of immaturity.</p>
                <h3>Can I tell you this dank feature you can include?</h2>
                <P>Sure fam, send me an email at admin@findmeme.cc</P>
